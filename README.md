# NICE_Experiments_Notebook

1. The 'NICE_SynGumbelSourceExperiment_Main.ipynb' contains all codes of NICE experiment on synthetic Gumbel sources.

3). The distribution parameters are obtained from maximum likelihood estimation on fMRI synthetic sources from SimTB. The 'evfit' function is used for the implementation in the MATLAB.
4). The plot of correlation and histogram matching results after 100 epochs training is recorded for you to check. Results are not the early stopping results but already valid.
